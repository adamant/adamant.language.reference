## Packages

The *package* is the fundamental unit of deployment in Adamant. A package may be an executable or library. A package is compiled from one or more *source files* and a *package configuration*. Source files are formally described as *compilation units*. A source file is a sequence of unicode scalar values encoded in UTF-8. It is a non-fatal compilation error for a source file to begin with a unicode byte order mark. Source files typically have a one-to-one correspondence with files in a file system, but this is not required. The location of the source files relative to a root directory for the package source files is the basis of namespaces within the package. The package configuration specifies configuration values needed to properly compile the package such as the root namespace, package name, referenced packages, and aliases for the referenced packages.
