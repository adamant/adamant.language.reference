# Enumerations

Enumerations are types that can have a number of "variants." These variants can be a simple set of constant values, or they could be distinct data types. Thus they provide a [discriminated union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union) type. In type theory this is known as a sum type.

Both classes and structs can enumerations, and there are important differences in their behavior and use.
