## Syntactic Analysis

The syntactic grammar of Adamant is defined throughout this reference. The terminals of the syntatic grammar are the tokens defined by the lexical grammar. The syntactic grammar specifies how tokens are combined to make programs.

Every source file in an Adamant program must match the `compilation_unit` production of the syntatic grammar ([Compilation Units](namespaces.md#compilation-units)).
