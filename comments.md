# Comments

	// A single line comment

	/* this is a block comment
	let x = 5; // it can contain code and other comments

	/// And this is a doc comment for the next declaration
	/// It can contain Markua (markua.com) formatting.

**Need a way to have package level comments.  Rust uses //! to mean comment the containing element, but that seems useless except for crates and strange otherwise.**
