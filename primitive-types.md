# Primitive Types

The *primitive types* are those types that exist as part of the language. They are not in the standard library and are available without referencing any package. Operations on primitive types are inherent to the language and the compiler knows how to implement them. However, the primitive types contain only the most basic of operations on them. The standard library extends them with a lot of functionality.

There are two kinds of primitive types. The *basic types* are keywords of the language.<sup>1</sup> Basic types make up the majority of the primitive types. In addition to the basic types, there is the optional type which is a *built-in type* with special syntax.
