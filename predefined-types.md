# Predefined Types

The predefined types are those types that exist as part of the language. They are not in the standard library and are available without referencing any package. Operations on predefined types are inherent to the language and the compiler knows how to implement them. However, the predefined types contain only the most basic of operations on them. The standard library extends them with a lot of functionality.
