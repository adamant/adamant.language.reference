# Comments

    // A single line comment

    /* this is a block comment
    let x = 5; // it can contain code and other comments
    */

    /// And this is a doc comment for the next declaration
    /// It can contain Markua (markua.com) formatting.

**Need a way to have package level comments. Rust uses `//!` to mean comment the containing element, but that seems useless except for crates and strange otherwise.**
