The `yield` keyword acts basically as `yield return` does in C#.

Python uses `return` for the equivalent of `yield break`, however that causes an inconsistency where removing yield from a method changes the meaning of the return. Adamant should use either `yield break;` or `yield return;` or something else.

Python has `yield from` for recursively yielding another iterator (Python already used `from` for other things). A paper proposed `yield foreach` for the same thing in C#. Adamant doesn't have a `foreach` or `from` keyword and isn't likely to get either. Options for this are `yield for`, `yield from`, and `yield all`.
