# Contracts and Assertions

## Abandonment

Abandonment conditions are allowed to report their error early. The compiler doesn't need to preserve there order relative to each other or other code.

## Contracts

Contracts are a special type of attribute. Like all attributes they are introduced by the at sign, but are followed by an expression instead of arguments. There are three kinds of contracts:

  * `@requires` - enforces preconditions. Has immutable access to all parameter values and the public interface of the current class.
  * `@ensures` - enforces postconditions. Has access to the original value of arguments, new and old state of the current class and return value. Can access the return value with the name `return`
  * `@invariant` - must hold before and after every method of a class. I assume this is only public methods, but perhaps there needs to be a way to declare invariants that apply to private methods as well.

Not sure how contracts being attributes interacts with the fact that they need to apply to subtyping.

## Enforcement
  * By default, all contracts are checked at runtime.
  * The compiler is free to prove contracts false, and issue compile-time errors.
  * The compiler is free to prove contracts true, and remove these runtime checks.

Which one happens varies by call site so that at one call site the compiler might prove a precondition satisfied while at another one there must be a runtime check.

## Accessing

Midori used `old` keyword as a way to reference the previous state of `this` and then `old()` as a function of an argument to access the previous value of an argument. One concern about that is whether it might require copying the value.

# Assertions

    Debug.Assert(condition);
    Release.Assert(condition);

Both of these will panic if the condition is not true. Debug assertions are only checked when compiling for debug while release assertions are checked even in release builds.
