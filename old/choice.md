# Choice Expressions

There are two constructs which allow the choice of which code to execute. They are `if` `else` and `match`.

## `if` Statement

    if condition
    {
        // executed if condition is true
    }

### `else` Statement

    if condition
    {
        // executed if condition is true
    }
    else
    {
        // executed if condition is false
    }

### `else if` Statement

    if condition1
    {
        // executed if condition1 is true
    }
    else if condition2
    {
        // executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
    }
    else // optional else
    {
        // executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is false
    }

### `if` Expressions

If is actually an expression that can evaluate to a value. By default the value of an `if` expression is `void`. Just like a function call returning `void`, they can't be used inside an expression because there is no value of the type `void`. However, an expression block can be used to provide a value for a branch of the `if`.

    let x = if condition => "true" else => "false";

This can be used with `else if` as well. Each `if` must have an expression block and the values must be convertible to a common type.

For `if` expressions without an else case, the expression evaluates to `none` in the else case. So if the result of the then block is of type `T`, then the result of the whole expression is of type `T?`.

    let x = (if condition => "value") ?? "default";

When more complex operations are needed in an if expression, expression blocks with braces can be used.

    let x = if condition
        {
            DoSomething();
            => "true";
        }
        else
        {
            DoSomethingElse();
            => "false";
        }; // semi-colon ends let statement

It is an error to have statements after the `=>` statement in the block.

Note that expression blocks can only be used where a block expression is expected, so neither of these statements will compile.

    var x = => "Hello";
    x = {
            DoSomething();
            => "Goodbye";
        };

## `match` Statement

A match statement allows the selection of choices based on matching a value to patterns.

    match v
    {
        [0, y]
        {
            Action(y);
        },
        _ // Matches anything
        {
            SomethingElse();
        }, // last comma optional
    }

The compiler checks that the conditions are exhaustive.

## `match` Expressions

Like `if`, `match` is an expression of type `void` by default, but can be given an expression value using expression blocks.

    let z = match v
        {
            [0, y]
            {
                Action();
                => y;
            },
            [x, 0] => x,
            [x, y] => x + y, // last comma optional
        };
