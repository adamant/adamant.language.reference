# Async and Await

Principle: Async Everywhere - use async in lots of places

Operations that should be async, Disk, Network, Screen (writing to Console can be slower than writing to file), inter thread and process communication, and sleeping.

* Principle: No Blocking Operations - it should be impossible to block a thread
* Principle: Don't divide the world into red and green methods

Idea: for functions returning void, it would be safe to allow them to be async like C# does where it will let you call one but then you have no way to determine when it is finished. The catch would be that they need to be declared `no throw` so there was no risk of exceptions being lost.

It still seems to make sense to indicate that some actions are expected to be async and that should be dealt with.

There really needs to be back-pressure and throttling in async operations.

There are different kinds of functions:

* Expected to be prompt, synchronous
* Expected to be asynchronous

Independently of that, you have functions that can throw exceptions and those that can't. Of course, it seems like there could be functions you expect to be prompt, synchronous that aren't. Also, distinguishing these in the type system seems to lead to fragility problems. We are implying that we always know in an interface what our subclass implementation will be. Given you can implement the interface of any class, that feels dangerous.

Coroutine like behavior

* await a result
* pull from an iterator
* push to an observable

iterator and observable are dual, it would be good if they could be unified

Note: Promises will have to carry information about what exceptions they can throw so we can know what exceptions our function can throw

CPU bound vs IO bound. In C#, use `Task.Run` for CPU bound, but it sounds like it really depends on who the caller is for whether you want that, so perhaps the rule should be that you push onto the caller to `Task.Run` you if needed?

Note: `Promise<T>` may be a good example of a struct that should be a move type. Generally, only one person should be awaiting it.

-------

Idea: Implicit awaits. Any time the compiler sees a conversion from `async T` to `T` it could insert an `await`. In other languages, that would be horrible, it would confuse the shared state. But with lifetimes in Adamant, the compiler would correctly enforce mutability. If it wasn't right you'd get a compiler error and could add an `await`.

-------

## Best Idea so Far

Functions can be marked `async` and should not return `Promise<T>`. Any function marked `async` must either be called with `await` or `async`. Using `await` on an async function causes the current functions execution to block until the async function is complete. Using `async` causes the async function to run until it blocks, then returns a `Promise<T>` allowing concurrency control. Functions with an `await` in them must either be marked `async` or `sync`. The `sync` keyword is used to adapt async code to a synchronous interface and should rarely be used.

Implementation: Async functions are regular functions. `await` on most async functions causes essentially zero overhead. When an `await` occurs on an unfulfilled promise or otherwise blocks, then control is returned to the nearest containing `async`. There an unfulfilled promise is created and execution continues. It is at this point that the stack branches so that future calls will be made on a new stack branch. The arm between an `async` and the blocked `await` is called an *activity*.

No blocking is allowed to block a system thread. All "blocking" should release the OS thread to the threadpool.

There is a threadpool that runs tasks. The threadpool has two zones a pool of regular task threads and a pool of blocking task threads. If a thread is stuck on a single task too long it is removed from the regular pool and places in the blocked pool. This is to ensure there are always a number of threads available for short tasks nearly equal to the number of CPUs.

If you want something to run concurrently you can do `async Async.Task(()->{...})`. If it is expected to be computationally long or is calling a blocking external method (blocking external APIs should be avoided at all costs). Use `Async.BlockingTask()` instead to use a thread from the block task thread pool. The result will of course be a promise you should eventually await. However, if there are no exceptions thrown by the task, you can call a method (name?) to disconnect from the result because the task can't fail. Maybe there should be another function that will cause the process to panic if an exception is thrown from the task. This makes it clear that promises will have types indicating the exceptions they can throw.

## Alternative Syntax

The keyword `async` doesn't clearly indicate its semantics when used on a function call. The keywords `begin` or `start` might be better.

The `sync` keyword may not be useful, or may be better handled with a syntax to indicate that you are explicitly overriding a sync method with an async method. The subclass method is then treated as async unless being called through the base class.

There may be an issue with `await` and `async` being prefix. This means they don't mix well with function call chains.

    let x = await (await (await Foo()).Bar()).Baz();

This could be addressed by switching to some postfix syntax. For example, `Foo()^.Bar()^.Baz()^` or `Foo()^.Bar()^.Baz()^`. Alternatively, a `.` could automatically await its parameter in an async method. This would not be too crazy if the `Promise<T>` override the dot operator to consume `self` that way you could only await in one place using dot. (Note: the ampersand makes some sense here as do something "and then" do something else).

## Async loops

**TODO:** async `for`


-----

## Another Approach

Have methods that return `Promise<T>` their implementation can then be declared async to have them work like C# async methods. You can await a task in any method. You can also call a sync method with the async keyword so that if it blocks on an async method, you will get a task.

Notes from 2017-10-15

Believe decided on `Promise<T>` that is consistent with reading of generics as "Promise of T"

Await keyword, await a promise

Async, strange that it is put in front of method name. Considered putting async near the return type. even then it looks like it is part of the signature. Might make more sense if it were after the signature. Like before the block. But not sure about that. To avoid contagion of async/await one should be able to await a task inside a non-async method that does not return a task. That should be safe because I'll just suspend the thread. However, it could still block the main line of execution. It still encourages non-async way of programming. Might make sense if you could await any method. That way if there was async stuff inside of it, you could allow that to run in parallel. However because of the way async works where it executes up to the first async operation, then you won't get async behavior. This is why go has go routines that always start another thread. That seems like it could just be a library,  however to make it really common it makes sense to make it a language feature. If you allow async on any method then you don't really need Promise. It is like everything returns Promise. You could just async anywhere any time. However, without the Promise you are encouraging people to write in synchronous where for example they call IO in a synchronous way without awaiting.
