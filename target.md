# Target

No programming language can be the best language for everything. It is important for languages to be clear not only what they are meant for, but what they are *not* meant for. To that end, this section lists some assumptions Adamant makes about the target machine, environment, and usage.

* 8 bit bytes
* heap/dynamic allocation is available
* not for very small embedded applications

Adamant may be useful for some embedded applications. Larger platforms like Arduino have 8 bit bytes and support dynamic memory allocation. It would be fine for those.
